The purpose of this application is to help users identify potential spam email messages by scanning for common spam-related words and phrases. By implementing a simple scoring system, users can gauge the likelihood of an email being spam based on its content.

- Prompt user to enter an email message

- We can compile a list of 30 common spam words that are typically found in spam emails

- Use the list of spam words and scan the user's Input via loop
   - We can create a function to scan the user's email message, and each time a keyword or phrase is found, we can add a point to a spam count var

- Once the score is totaled, we can have a conditional sort that count into a variety of spam categories.
   - if the score is < 3 we can mark it as not likely to be spam, 4-7 points possibly spam, 8+ points Most likely spam

- We can then display
   - Spam score
   - Which category the user's spam score falls into
   - The words that were flagged
