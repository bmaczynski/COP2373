We need to create a file that contains responses from the 8 ball
We also need to read those responses from that file
After that we can ask a user a yes or no question, and displaying a random response from that list
The final step would be to repeat the process until user quits


In order to achieve the magic 8 ball, we need to:

- Create a list of responses
- Open the file in write mode
- Write each response to the file, each on a new line. We can use \n
- Then we open the file in read mode
- Read each line from the file, stripping the newline character, and store the lines in a list

- Greet the user
- Enter while loop to prompt user to ask yes/no question until they quit
- Display a random line from the file.
- After exiting the loop, print a goodbye message.
