2.	Implement methods for adjusting the interest rate, depositing, withdrawing, and calculating interest.
	-	Define methods: adjust_interest_rate, deposit, withdraw, balance, and calculate_interest.

3.	Store account details and perform operations.
	-	Store account details using instance variables and perform operations by calling the defined methods.

4.	Display account information and results of operations.
	-	Use the str method to return a string representation of the accountâ€™s state.
   
5.	Test the functionality by creating an instance of BankAcct and performing operations.
	-	Create a BankAcct instance and test deposit, withdraw, and adjust_interest_rate methods.
	-	Print account information and calculated interest to verify functionality.
