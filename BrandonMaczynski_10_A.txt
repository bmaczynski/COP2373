	1.	Class Definition

	      - Use inheritance from Decimal to create a Money class
         - Money class should handle value and currency units

	2.	Initialization

	      - Override __new__ to create a new instance of Money as a subclass of Decimal
		   - Initialize units attribute in __new__

	3.	String Representation

	      - Override __str__ to return the value along with currency units

   4. Mathematical Methods

         - Create methods to add, subtract, and multiply currencies
         - We can create new money variables to hold the total for each method

	5.	Test Function

	      - Create instances of Money with different values and units
	      - Test addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations
	      - Catch and print errors

	6.	Test Case

	      - Adding two Money objects with the same units
	      - Subtracting two Money objects with the same units
	      - Multiplying a Money object by a number
	      - Adding Money objects with different units should raise an error
