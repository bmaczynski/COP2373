Create a Python script that allows the user to enter any number of sentences, including those that begin with numbers. The program will display the sentences and the count of sentences.

1. Prompt the user to enter sentences until they decide to stop.
   - We can use a while loop and break when keyword exit is typed

2. Refactoring the code for resubmission:
   - Using 7.4, we can implement a pattern variable that holds the validation for the sentences typed by the user
   - We can use this pattern variable in a re.findall() method for validation of a proper sentence

3. Store each sentence in a list.
   - We can use append() to essentially inject input gathered into an empty list

4. Display all entered sentences.
   - Display the list by looping through the list, printing every entry

5. Display the count of sentences.
   - Print the length of the newly updated list
