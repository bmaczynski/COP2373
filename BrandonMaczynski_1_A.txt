Below is the assignment rewritten for easier understanding.
____________________________________________

Write app that sells limited tickets to a cinema.

Each person can buy a maximum of 4 tickets.

20 maximum tickets can be sold.

Ask user for desired number of tickets.
Since we're asking for a number of tickets, we must convert their input to an integer with int.

Display number of remaining tickets after they choose a number.

Repeat (loop) until 20 tickets have been sold.

Once all tickets have been sold, display total number of buyers.

We must use a function, input, output, accumulator, conditional logic, and loops in order to achieve the above assignment.
____________________________________________

The variables we need are:

total_tickets
tickets_left
total_buyers
requested_tickets

All of the variables must be stored as integers.
